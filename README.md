The SKALE is an Ethereum native multichain network of high-performance blockchains, that handles millions of transactions per week.

The network is open-source and is built to scale Ethereum dApps. The Network enables dApp developers to access validator-operated nodes' compute power and storage to run fast, containerized, EVM-compatible SKALE Chains.
