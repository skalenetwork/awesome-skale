# Awsome SKALE

The SKALE is an Ethereum native multichain network of high-performance fast-finality blockchains, that handles millions of transactions per week.

The network is open-source and is built to scale Ethereum dApps. It includes build-in interchain-transfers that allow to send tokens, NFTS and custom messages from one SKALE chain to another and from SKALE to Ethereum mainnet.
